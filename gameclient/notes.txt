all actions will be physically simulated. 

    * firing a gun will create recoil that can push the players if friction of surface they are on is too low or in the air
    * some slopes in the map will be low friction to slide down and gain high velocity
    * krunker style slide and hop will be a thing but you cannot go past the speed limit with it without downward slopes
